### Step 4: **Commit Your Changes**
1. After adding your content to `index.md`, scroll down and click **Commit new file**.
2. Your site will be automatically built and published by GitHub Pages.

---

### Step 5: **View Your Website**
1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages** to confirm that GitHub Pages is enabled.
2. GitHub will give you the live link to your website, which should look like this:  
   `https://ds-ninja.github.io/Dmitrij-Levyj/`

### Step 6: **Customize Your Site**
You can further customize the look of your site by:
1. Changing the theme in `_config.yml` (e.g., from `jekyll-theme-cayman` to another theme like `jekyll-theme-slate` or `jekyll-theme-minimal`).
2. Adding more pages, like `about.md` or `projects.md`.
3. Customizing the layout, fonts, and colors by adding your own `style.css`.

---

### Alternative: **Manual Theme Application**
If you prefer more design control, you can manually select a Jekyll theme from these sources:
- [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/)
- [Jekyll Theme Gallery](https://jekyllthemes.io/)

These themes are easy to integrate into GitHub Pages by simply copying the theme's configuration into your `_config.yml` file.
